# Garden Tracker App
I'm customizing an app for myself to keep track of my garden's plants, and in the future, maybe more.

## MVP
* Stores data about plants
* Allows user to update data about plants (CRUD)

## Future Ideas:
* Organize annual photos
* Allows user to add observations about plants, organized by date
* Visualization of observations over time
* Requests updates about plants from user (if plant hasn't been observed on in a certain period of time)
